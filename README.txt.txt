CS 458.001 - Final Project

Topic - Warehouse Management System

This program first presents the user with the 'homepage' or 'index' page in which the user is able to select from
different options available to them pertaining to a warehouse management system.  The user has the option of selecting from 4 different categories: Inventory, Orders, Deliveries, and Sales.  Each page has a table presenting information about that topic (i.e. Inventory page has a table pulling from our database listing all the items currently in the database 'for sale').  The user has the option of editing, adding, or deleting these items as well.  The user can also edit the deliveries in the database to change the status of the delivery from 'In progress' to 'Delivered' or other options.  Finally, the user also has the ability to add items to a running cart (updated with a cart table) from a page that displays different 'items' that the database has including a desktop computer, mouse, and mousepad.
